Simplified Data Encryption Standard Algorithm

Programming Language: Python 2.7.13

Compiling Instruction: S_DES_proj1.py is a python file which is submitted
alongwith this document.
User has to open this python file in any IDE based on python 2.7.13.
Then user has to run this file.
Program waits for user to enter the command so user has to enter
command in following format and then press enter.

Following is the example of command require to run SDES algorithm:
mycipher -m decrypt -k 1010010001 -i 10101010 -p C:\Secure Telecom trans\plain.jpg -c C:\Secure Telecom trans\cipher.jpx

This command include the function (encrypt/decrypt), Initial key(10-bit), Initial vector(8-bit), 
Plain text file name and Cipher text file name.
